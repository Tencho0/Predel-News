## 1. Executive Summary

PredelNews enters the Southwest Bulgaria news market as a credibility-first, mobile-optimized local news site competing against low-trust incumbents like pirinsko.com and fragmented Facebook news groups. The launch strategy is entirely organic: zero paid advertising budget, a three-person team (founder/editor + 2 writers) producing ~15–20 articles per week, and distribution through Facebook groups, a Telegram channel, SEO, and short-form video repurposing on TikTok and YouTube Shorts. The core bet is that consistent quality, transparent sourcing, and a clean reading experience will compound into organic search traffic and word-of-mouth sharing within 90 days — creating the audience foundation needed to sell direct ad packages to local businesses.

Monetization launches from day one with AdSense as a passive baseline, but the real revenue strategy begins in weeks 4–6 with direct outreach to 20–30 local businesses using a "Founding Partner" introductory package (discounted 3-month banner + optional sponsored article). The founder/editor owns early sales. The goal is to reach 5,000 monthly unique visitors and 1–2 signed direct advertisers within 90 days, proving the model before scaling editorial capacity or investing in paid distribution.

## 2. Assumptions

The following assumptions were made where answers were directional but not definitive. Each is numbered for stakeholder review.

| ID | Assumption | Impact if Wrong |
|----|-----------|-----------------|
| GA1 | Monthly marketing spend stays at €0–150 for months 1–6. All growth tactics are organic/sweat-equity. A small reserve (~€50/month) may be used for occasional Facebook post boosts targeting Blagoevgrad region. | If budget increases, paid social distribution and Google Ads for branded keywords become viable accelerators. |
| GA2 | The founder/editor dedicates ~15–20 hours/week to non-editorial work (sales outreach, social distribution, community management) in addition to editorial duties. | If founder time is less available, sales outreach and social posting frequency will suffer; a part-time community/sales assistant would be needed. |
| GA3 | Branded social accounts (Facebook Page, TikTok, YouTube, Telegram) are created 1–2 weeks before public site launch during the pre-launch phase. | If accounts are created later, the pre-launch audience warm-up period is lost. |
| GA4 | Legal templates (Privacy Policy, Terms of Use, Editorial Policy) are published before launch using standard Bulgarian-market templates, with professional legal review scheduled within 60 days post-launch. | If legal review is delayed beyond 60 days, GDPR-related risks around email collection and cookie consent increase. |
| GA5 | pirinsko.com and local Facebook groups are the primary competitive reference. No well-funded competitor is expected to enter this market during the first 6 months. | If a funded competitor launches, the differentiation strategy (trust, quality, speed) must be accelerated and defended with higher content volume. |
| GA6 | The Blagoevgrad region Facebook group ecosystem (neighborhood groups, parent groups, expat groups, municipal interest pages) contains at least 15–20 active groups where link-sharing is permitted or tolerated. | If group admins block news links, Facebook distribution will rely more heavily on the branded Page and personal shares, reducing initial reach. |
| GA7 | No contests, giveaways, or incentivized referral programs will run until legal review is complete. Email collection relies on the homepage signup bar with a consent checkbox only. | Slower email list growth in months 1–2 compared to strategies using lead magnets or contests. |
| GA8 | The team can produce 2–3 short-form videos per week (TikTok/YouTube Shorts) by repurposing article content with simple talking-head or text-overlay formats using a smartphone. No video editing software budget is assumed. | If video production is too time-consuming, the channel is deprioritized in favor of Facebook and SEO — which remain the primary traffic sources. |

For social bios, Open Graph descriptions, and the homepage meta description:

- Primary: **"Новини от Югозападна България. Оригинални. Проверени. Бързи."**

- Short (for social bios): **"Новини от Благоевград и Югозападна България 📰"**

### 4.4 Competitive Differentiation Matrix

---

## 5. Content Strategy for Launch

### 5.1 Content Mix

The editorial calendar should balance three content types to serve both immediate traffic (breaking/trending) and long-term SEO (evergreen).

| Content Type | % of Weekly Output | Purpose | SEO Value | Social Shareability |
|-------------|-------------------|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| **Breaking / Daily News** | 50–60% | Timeliness; reason to check back daily; Facebook/Viber share triggers | Low (decays fast) | High (immediate shares) |
| **Explainer / Context** | 20–25% | "Why this matters" follow-ups to breaking news; builds trust and depth | Medium (some long-tail) | Medium |
| **Evergreen / Reference** | 15–25% | "Къде да се ходи в Благоевград", "Полезни телефони за региона", historical context pieces, seasonal guides | High (compounds over months) | Low initially, grows via search |

### 5.2 Publishing Cadence

| Period | Target Articles/Week | Daily Rhythm |
|--------|---------------------|--------------|
| Pre-launch (content loading) | 20–30 total (seed content) | Batch production over 1–2 weeks |
| Weeks 1–4 | 15 | 2–3 articles/day on weekdays; 1/day weekends |
| Weeks 5–12 | 18–20 | 3–4 articles/day on weekdays |
| Months 4–6 | 20–25 | Increase if team capacity grows |

### 5.3 Category & Region Strategy

**Lead categories at launch (highest local demand + SEO opportunity):**

1. **Криминално** — Crime/incidents drive the highest immediate search volume and social shares in regional Bulgarian markets. Every police report, fire, accident, and court case in Blagoevgrad region is a content opportunity.
2. **Общество** — Community news (municipal decisions, infrastructure, schools, health) is the core of a regional publication's identity.
3. **Политика** — Local and regional political coverage. Municipal council sessions, mayoral decisions, party statements.

**Secondary categories (grow as capacity allows):**

4. **Спорт** — Local football clubs, school sports, regional tournaments.
5. **Култура** — Events, festivals, theatre, local history features.
6. **Икономика / Бизнес** — Business openings, closures, employment, economic data.

**Region priority:** Blagoevград region first (70%+ of content). Kyustendil and Pernik regions as secondary (20%). България/national tie-ins (10%) for context pieces connecting local stories to national developments.

### 5.4 SEO Content Pillars (Evergreen)

These are high-value, long-tail search targets to produce during the first 90 days. Each is a single article or small cluster designed to rank for persistent local queries:

| Topic Cluster | Target Keywords (BG) | Format |
|--------------|---------------------|--------|
| Emergency contacts & services | "спешни телефони Благоевград", "полиция Благоевград телефон" | Reference page, updated annually |
| Municipal services guide | "община Благоевград работно време", "документи лична карта Благоевград" | How-to guide |
| Local event calendar | "събития Благоевград", "какво да правим в Благоевград" | Monthly updated list article |
| Transport & routes | "разписание автобуси Благоевград София", "пътна обстановка Кресна" | Reference + seasonal updates |
| Neighborhood / area guides | "квартали Благоевград", "живот в Благоевград" | Evergreen explainer |
| Historical features | "история на Благоевград", landmarks, notable events | Long-form, linkable |

### 5.5 Pre-Launch Seed Content

Before the site goes live publicly, the following content must be published and indexed:

- [ ] 20–30 articles across ≥ 3 categories and ≥ 2 regions (per PRD §14.3).
- [ ] At least 3–5 evergreen/reference articles from the SEO pillar list above.
- [ ] All 5 footer pages populated with real content (За нас, Реклама, Рекламна оферта, Контакти, Всички новини).
- [ ] Privacy Policy page published (template-based; legal review pending).
- [ ] At least 1 active poll.
- [ ] Author pages for all active writers with bios and photos.

## 6. Distribution Plan by Channel

### 6.1 Channel Priority Matrix

| Channel | Priority | Role | Weekly Time Investment | Expected Traffic Contribution (90 days) |
|---------|----------|------|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Facebook (Page + Groups)** | Primary | Main discovery channel for local readers; viral sharing loop | 8–10 hrs/week | 40–50% |
| **Google Search (SEO)** | Primary | Compounds over time; evergreen + breaking news search traffic | Built into editorial process | 20–30% (growing) |
| **Telegram Channel** | Secondary | Retention & notification substitute; loyal reader base | 2–3 hrs/week | 5–10% |
| **TikTok** | Secondary | Reach younger audience; brand awareness; drive curiosity clicks | 3–5 hrs/week | 5–10% |
| **YouTube Shorts** | Tertiary | Cross-post TikTok content; secondary search/discovery | 1 hr/week (cross-post) | 2–5% |
| **Viber** | Tertiary | Reader-to-reader sharing (organic); no owned channel at MVP | 0 (organic sharing) | 10–15% (referral) |
| **Direct / Bookmarks** | Tertiary | Returning visitors who type the URL or use bookmarks | 0 (earned) | 5–10% (growing) |

### 6.2 Facebook Strategy

**Page setup (pre-launch):**
- Create `facebook.com/predelnews` Page.
- Profile photo: logo. Cover photo: branded banner with tagline.
- Complete "About" section with website link, mission statement, contact info.
- Set CTA button to "Visit website."

**Posting cadence:**
- Every published article is shared to the Page (auto or manual) with a 1–2 sentence hook + cover image. Target: 3–4 posts/day on weekdays, 1–2 on weekends.
- 1 engagement post per week (poll question, "Какво мислите?", or discussion prompt related to a trending local topic).
- 1 "behind the scenes" or team introduction post per month (trust building).

**Group distribution:**
- Identify 15–20 active Facebook groups in the Blagoevgrad/SW Bulgaria region (neighborhood groups, "Какво се случва в Благоевград", parent groups, buy/sell groups with news discussions).
- Share articles to groups where link-sharing is permitted. Prioritize groups with 5,000+ members.
- Never spam: 1–2 links per group per day maximum. Vary the articles. Include a genuine comment or question with each share. Follow each group's rules.
- Use the founder's personal profile for group posting (more trusted than a Page in groups).
- Track which groups drive the most clicks (UTM parameters: `?utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=group&utm_campaign={group_name}`).

**Boosted posts (when budget allows):**
- Reserve €30–50/month for boosting 2–3 high-performing organic posts.
- Target: Blagoevgrad region, ages 25–55, interests: news, local community.
- Success criteria: cost per link click < €0.05; boost only posts that already have above-average organic engagement.

### 6.3 SEO Strategy

**On-page SEO (built into editorial workflow):**
- Every article has a unique SEO title, meta description, and OG image (CMS enforces this per functional spec).
- Headlines target high-intent local search queries (e.g., "Пожар в Благоевград: какво се случи и какви са щетите" rather than "Огнен ужас в града!!!").
- Evergreen articles target long-tail keywords with 100–1,000 monthly searches.
- Internal linking: every article links to 1–2 related articles or category pages. Evergreen reference pages link to breaking news follow-ups and vice versa.

**Technical SEO (handled by development; GTM dependency):**
- XML sitemap at `/sitemap.xml` with < 60 min freshness (per FR-SE-001).
- JSON-LD `NewsArticle` and `BreadcrumbList` schemas on all article pages (per FR-SE-005).
- Canonical URLs, robots.txt, and HTTPS enforcement (per NFR specs).
- Submit sitemap to Google Search Console on launch day.

**Off-page SEO:**
- Submit the site to local Bulgarian web directories (bglink.com, dir.bg, other active Bulgarian directories).
- Reach out to 3–5 regional websites or bloggers for reciprocal links or mentions (not link schemes — genuine editorial references).
- Every social share is a signal. High-share articles generate natural backlinks over time.

**Google Discover readiness:**
- Publish high-quality, image-rich articles with cover images ≥ 1200px wide (Discover's minimum).
- Avoid clickbait headlines (Discover penalizes them).
- Publish consistently (Discover favors sites with regular fresh content).
- Expect Discover traffic to begin appearing 2–4 months post-launch once Google trusts the domain. This is not guaranteed but is a meaningful upside channel for regional news.

### 6.4 Telegram Channel

**Setup:** Create `t.me/predelnews` before public launch.

**Content cadence:**
- Post every published article as a short message: headline + 1-sentence hook + link. No full article text in Telegram (drive clicks to the site).
- 1 editorial note per week (founder's voice: "Какво следим тази седмица", upcoming coverage plans, reader Q&A).
- Pin the "За нас" page link and the email signup link.

**Growth tactics:**
- Link to Telegram channel from the site footer, About page, and article pages (small "Последвай ни в Telegram" link or icon).
- Cross-promote in Facebook posts: "За бързи известия, следвайте ни в Telegram: t.me/predelnews."
- Include channel link in the founder's personal social bios.

**Target:** 200 subscribers in 90 days; 500 in 6 months.

### 6.5 TikTok & YouTube Shorts

**Account:** Create `@predelnews` on TikTok and YouTube.

**Content format:**
- **Format A — "60-second news brief":** Founder or writer on camera summarizing a breaking local story. Smartphone recording, natural lighting, basic text overlays (use CapCut free tier). CTA: "Цялата статия — линк в био."
- **Format B — "Знаехте ли?" (Did you know?):** Interesting local facts, historical trivia, or evergreen content repurposed as short videos. Text-on-screen with background footage/images.
- **Format C — "Какво се случи тази седмица":** Weekly 90-second roundup of top local stories.

**Cadence:** 2–3 TikToks per week. Cross-post to YouTube Shorts (same video file) and Instagram Reels (if Instagram account is created).

**TikTok link-in-bio:** Use a simple link aggregator (Linktree free tier or direct link to the homepage) so viewers can find the article.

### 6.6 Viber (Organic Sharing)

Viber is the dominant messaging app in Bulgaria. PredelNews does not create an owned Viber Community at MVP (Telegram is lower friction to manage). Instead, Viber is treated as an organic referral channel:

- The share button on every article page includes a Viber share option (per FR-PW-008).
- Articles with high emotional or community relevance (incidents, school news, municipal decisions) are the most likely to be shared in Viber family and friend groups.
- Track Viber referral traffic in GA4 (referrer: `viber.com` or app deep-link patterns).
- Consider launching a Viber Community in Phase 2 once readership exceeds 10,000 monthly uniques (management overhead is higher than Telegram).

### 6.7 Partnerships & Cross-Promotion

**Target partners (months 1–3):**

| Partner Type | Example | Value Exchange |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Local municipal websites | `blagoevgrad.bg`, neighborhood portals | Propose a "news feed" widget or reciprocal linking |
| Local event organizers | Concert promoters, festival committees, sports clubs | Free event coverage in exchange for social media cross-promotion |
| University / student organizations | СУ "Неофит Рилски" student media | Guest content, shared distribution |
| Local Facebook group admins | Admins of top 5 regional groups | Build personal relationships; offer early access to breaking stories in exchange for favorable sharing terms |
| Other small media (non-competing) | Food bloggers, travel bloggers covering SW Bulgaria | Cross-linking, guest features |

---

## 7. Newsletter Plan

Newsletter sending is Phase 2, but email collection starts on day one. The GTM approach:

### 7.1 Collection Mechanics (Phase 1)

- **Homepage signup bar** (FR-PW-006): email input + consent checkbox. Positioned below the main content blocks for visibility without being intrusive.
- **End-of-article CTA** (optional, lightweight): a single line below the tags section — "Абонирайте се за бюлетина ни: [email field]." This is a text-level CTA, not a pop-up.
- **Telegram channel pinned message:** links to the email signup page.
- **Facebook Page "About" section:** mentions the upcoming newsletter.

### 7.2 Messaging

Signup prompt: **"Получавайте най-важните новини от региона директно в пощата си. Безплатно."** ("Get the most important regional news directly in your inbox. Free.")

Confirmation message on submit: **"Благодарим! Ще получите първия ни бюлетин скоро."** ("Thank you! You'll receive our first newsletter soon.")

### 7.3 Newsletter Launch Plan (Phase 2 Prep)

| Milestone | Target Date | Action |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| Collect first 200 emails | Day 30–60 | Continue organic collection |
| Select email platform | Day 60 | Evaluate Mailchimp, Brevo (Sendinblue), or Buttondown based on cost and Bulgarian-language support |
| First newsletter send | Day 75–90 | Weekly digest format: top 5 articles + 1 editor's pick + 1 poll + 1 ad slot |
| Iterate on format | Ongoing | A/B test subject lines; monitor open rate and CTR |

### 7.4 Newsletter Monetization (Phase 2)

- Single "Presented by [Sponsor]" slot in the newsletter header.
- Pricing: tied to subscriber count. At 500 subs, offer as a free add-on to direct banner packages. At 2,000+ subs, price separately (see `docs/business/media-kit.md`).

## 9. Monetization GTM

### 9.1 Revenue Ramp Timeline

| Month | Primary Revenue Source | Expected Monthly Revenue (EUR) |
|-------|----------------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | AdSense only (if approved) | €0–20 |
| 2 | AdSense + first direct-sold banner | €20–80 |
| 3 | AdSense + 1–2 direct banners + first sponsored article | €80–200 |
| 4–6 | AdSense + 2–3 direct banners + 1–2 sponsored articles/month | €150–400 |

These are conservative estimates. Actual revenue depends on traffic growth and advertiser conversion.

### 9.2 "Founding Partner" Launch Package

**Purpose:** Offer an irresistible introductory deal to land the first 3–5 advertisers before traffic proves itself.

| Package | Includes | Duration | Introductory Price (EUR) | Standard Price (after 90 days) |
|---------|---------|----------|-------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **Стартов Банер** (Starter Banner) | 1 sidebar banner (300×250), ad-sidebar-1 slot | 1 month | €50 | €100 |
| **Партньор** (Partner) | 1 sidebar banner + 1 sponsored article (with homepage pinning for 48 hours) | 1 month | €120 | €250 |
| **Основател** (Founder) | 2 banner slots (sidebar + in-article) + 2 sponsored articles + logo on "За нас" page as founding sponsor | 3 months | €300 | €650 |

**Terms:**
- All prices are exclusive of VAT.
- Sponsored articles carry the mandatory "Платена публикация" label (non-negotiable).
- Banner creatives are provided by the advertiser or can be designed by PredelNews for a small additional fee (€20–30).
- Founding Partner pricing is available only for the first 5 advertisers and only during the first 90 days post-launch.

### 9.3 Sales Outreach Process

**Owner:** Founder/editor (no dedicated sales person at MVP).

**Weekly sales time allocation:** 3–5 hours/week.

**Outreach sequence:**

1. **Identify:** List 20–30 local businesses in Blagoevgrad that have active Facebook pages or Google Business profiles (they already spend on marketing). Prioritize: restaurants with 1,000+ Facebook followers, dental/medical clinics with Google Ads, real estate agencies with active listings.
2. **First contact:** In-person visit or Facebook message. Short pitch: "Стартираме нов новинарски сайт за Благоевград. Търсим 5 местни бизнеса за стартова партньорска програма с намалени цени. Мога ли да ви изпратя повече информация?"
3. **Send media kit:** PDF from the "Рекламна оферта" page with traffic projections, ad slot visuals, and Founding Partner pricing.
4. **Follow up:** 3–5 days later. Offer a 15-minute coffee meeting to discuss.
5. **Close:** Handshake deal or simple email agreement for the first 1–2 deals. Formal contracts can come later. Focus on getting banners live quickly.
6. **Deliver results:** After the first month, send a simple report: "Your banner was displayed approximately X,000 times on Y articles. Here's a screenshot."

### 9.4 AdSense Strategy

- Apply for AdSense during pre-launch or week 1 (Google requires some live content and traffic).
- If rejected initially, reapply at day 30 with 30+ articles and 1,000+ monthly page views.
- Configure all 6 ad slots to AdSense mode as default (per FR-MN-001).
- Monitor AdSense console weekly: check for policy warnings, review eCPM, identify high-performing pages.
- When a direct-sold banner is active, that slot switches to Direct-sold mode and takes priority over AdSense (per FR-MN-001 AC5).

| No video editor | Low | Use CapCut (free) for basic text overlays on TikTok. Upgrade only if video becomes a proven traffic channel. |
| No developer post-launch | Medium | Bug fixes and minor changes can be handled by Claude Code with founder oversight. Larger changes may require contracting. |

## 13. Risks & Mitigations

| # | Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|------|-----------|--------|------------|
| R1 | **Trust deficit:** Readers don't believe a new site produces original content; assume it's another aggregator | High | High | Prominent "За нас" page with editor/writer photos and bios. Author bylines on every article. Visible corrections policy. "100% оригинално съдържание" messaging in social bios. |
| R2 | **Facebook group bans:** Group admins remove posts or ban the founder's profile for "self-promotion" | Medium | High | Respect every group's rules. Post genuinely useful links (not every article). Engage in group discussions beyond just posting links. Diversify: never rely on one group for > 20% of traffic. |
| R3 | **SEO slow ramp:** Google takes 3–6 months to trust a new domain; organic search traffic is negligible in months 1–2 | High | Medium | Accept this reality. Facebook and Telegram are the primary channels for months 1–3. Invest in evergreen content early so SEO compounds. Submit sitemap day 1. |
| R4 | **Advertiser objection: "You have no traffic"** | High | Medium | Lead with the "Founding Partner" discount. Offer the first month free for the first 2 advertisers. Show growth trajectory ("we published 60 articles this month, here's our traffic graph"). Emphasize geographic targeting: "Every reader is in Blagoevgrad — can Facebook promise that?" |
| R5 | **Comment spam overwhelms moderation** | Medium | Medium | Phase 1 anti-spam measures (honeypot, rate limiting, link filtering, banned words). Founder monitors daily. Escalate to reCAPTCHA (Phase 2) if spam exceeds 20% of comment volume. Disable comments on individual articles if needed. |
| R6 | **Legal: defamation or GDPR complaint** | Low–Medium | High | Mandatory editor review before publish. Privacy policy published pre-launch. Data minimization enforced. Schedule legal review within 60 days. No contests/giveaways until legal review is complete. |
| R7 | **Advertiser content quality:** Sponsored articles from businesses are low quality or misleading | Low | High | All sponsored articles go through the standard editorial workflow. Editor has final approval. "Платена публикация" label is CMS-enforced and cannot be removed. Maintain the 1:10 sponsored-to-editorial ratio guideline. |
| R8 | **Founder burnout:** Single person handles editing, writing, sales, distribution, and community | High | High | Realistic capacity planning (this document). Prioritize ruthlessly: if something must be cut, cut TikTok before cutting article output. Hire part-time help when revenue allows. Build 2-week content buffer for vacation/illness. |
| R9 | **AdSense rejection or policy violation** | Medium | Low | AdSense is supplementary, not the primary revenue source. If rejected, reapply at 30 and 60 days. Ensure ad placement complies with AdSense policies (no misleading placement, no clicks near interactive elements). Direct-sold banners are the real revenue goal. |
| R10 | **Competitor reaction:** pirinsko.com or a new entrant improves quality in response to PredelNews | Low | Medium | Speed of execution is the defense. Build audience relationships (email, Telegram, direct visits) that are harder for competitors to poach than social followers. Maintain quality bar. Focus on coverage areas competitors neglect (explainers, evergreen, community features). |
